# Useful Links


# Known Issues
Some pages seem to be malformed:
- https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lecz - Conjunction section is h4, should be h3
- https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a#Polish - seems to have a ton of memory errors in the webpage
- https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chodzi%C4%87#Polish - some verbs seem to be missing abstraction (i.e. chodziÄ‡ is indeterminate)
