# Introduction
I'm gonna make some scripts to help me practice language learning. There are tons of resources online for language learning, but the amount can depend on the language, so finding more, fresh practice can be hard. In this repository, I compile a Language Training Toolkit to scrape resources of information and programatically make training material.
At present, I'll be focusing on resources for Polish. While I would like to generalize, the tools will be heavily geared towards the specifics of Polish, though it might generalize to other Slavic languages. If I keep working on this toolkit, the tools provided here might end up generalizing well across other languages.


# Testing
```
pytest
```


# Roadmap
- More extensive storage connector testing
- Storage connector exceptions
- cleaning up scraping exception
- handle connectivity issues with datastore
- handle web connectivity issues
- generalize language model use - right now, it's basically all for Polish, what happens when I add more languages?
